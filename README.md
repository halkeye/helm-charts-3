üëã Welcome to my Helm Charts repository. This repo contains Helm charts that I have developed to run applications in my [home Kubernetes cluster](https://github.com/bjw-s/home-ops/).
This repo is **not** intended to be a replacement for any of the large collections of Helm charts that are out there.

---

## Installation

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts in this repository.

The Helm repository can be installed as follows:

```console
helm repo add bjw-s https://bjw-s.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run `helm search repo bjw-s` to search the charts.
